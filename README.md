*Research Questions / Hypotheses*

Overarching Theme: What is the state of mental health among college students, and how is it impacted by elements such as geographic location, relationship status, social media usage and self-reported addiction level, platform usage, and amount of sleep per night?

*RamtinResearchQ*~1~: Something to do with geographic location? [11p-5a]

*FebeResearchQ*~2~: RQ1:Does sleep deprivation mediate the negative relationship between daily screen time and mental health scores? 
H1: Screen time negatively predicts sleep time, which in turn negatively impacts mental health.

RQ2:Is there a critical 'tipping point' in screen usage where sleep duration and mental health exhibit a sharp decline?
  H2: Students exceeding a threshold of 5 hours per day will report significantly worse outcomes compared to low-usage groups, whereas the difference between low (0~3) and moderate usage (3~5)may be minimal. (In my own experience, I use screens for 3–5 hours per day and do not perceive any notable mental-health issues)
  H3: However, this pattern may vary by gender, and the differences in outcomes may not be the same across male and female students.

*JamesResearchQ*~3~: Something to do with specific platform usage? [3p-8p]
